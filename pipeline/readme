something here to pull files from the geo repository
config.sh= setting up files and directories
1_align= using the bwa mem alignment
2_coverage= generate data for HIV coverage
3_summarize= generate a tab file for coverage data to plot in R
4a_DUP= remove duplications with samtools and piccard
4b_vcf= freebayes and vcffilter
4c_index
5_count.vcf= command lines for pulling relevant info from vcf files
6_fasta.sh= pull fasta seq for 5bp around mutation sites, and for 1 and 10
bp around chimeric integration sites.
7_chimera-generate bed and bg files for chimera sites
8_discord=generate bed and bg files for discordant sites
9_segmentation = segmentation analysis for chimeras/discordant
9b_score.sh= generates a score file
9c_score.sh1=generate a summary discordant file
9c_score.sh2=generates a summanry chimera file
file_counts.sh= generates counts for all files
run.fastqc.sh= runs fastc analysis on all samples
dedup.chimeras.py= a pysam program that pulls chimeric reads and manually
deduplicates them.(tools like rmdup ignores chimeric reads)
dedup.discordant.py=a pysam program that pulls discordant reads and
manually deduplicates them. (tools like rmdup ignores discordant reads)
integrants.dedup.sh- runs the python tools on all the samples to generate
a deduplicated chim.bam and dis.bam file
remove.integrants.sh- removes the integrant reads from the bam file so
that deduplication can be performed with 4a_DUP
trim.fastq -trims the files with trimmomatic to remove the first 2
basepairs of all sequences and the last 55 from the 125 bp reads 
uniq.mut.start.sh- uses the vcf files generated to determine the number of
uniq.start sites for each mutation call.  This helps clarify duplication
and is used for filtering in the R file
